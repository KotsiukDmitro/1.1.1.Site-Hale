My daughter is in healthcare and suggested Hale since it was designed by doctors at Johns Hopkins. I definitely notice a difference and can breathe better. The large size is terrific for me, but I am a big guy, over 6 feet tall. I love how no one can tell I have it in my nose, even my wife who always nags me to look nice when we go out. Thanks Hale, Now I sleep better at night!"</p>

I've tried sprays, allergy pills, neti pot, and other nasal devices, but this opens up my nose like nothing else. I do want to mention it doesn't feel like a magical cloud, it feels like you have something in your nose, because you do. I've gotten so used to wearing it I have to squeeze my nose to remember if I'm wearing it sometimes. You'll be blown away by your breathing and once you get used to it, you'll love it. I do anyway."</p>
